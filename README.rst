 clik
======

clik is designed to make writing subcommand-style command line
interfaces more pleasant. argparse_ is wonderful and powerful and
flexible and sanely designed, but requires a fair amount of
bookkeeping code. clik frees you from writing and maintaining that
bookkeeping code by providing a kind of "DSL" over argparse, letting
you focus on the logic for the problem at hand.

For more information, see the official documentation. (TODO: Link to
official documentation.)
