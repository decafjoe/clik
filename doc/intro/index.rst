The introductory materials revolve around a toy command-line
application for managing a todo list.

The tutorial walks through development of the application
step-by-step, explaining clik concepts along the way.

The screencast has roughly the same content as the tutorial but is, of
course, in video form.

For a *very* quick overview of clik, take a look at the example
listing linked below. It's the final code from the tutorial and, while
it may not make perfect sense, it should give you a good idea of what
clik applications look like.
