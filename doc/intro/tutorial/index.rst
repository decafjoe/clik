 Tutorial

The tutorial covers the step-by-step development of a toy command-line
application for managing a todo list. (Original, I know.) Reading time
is meant to be under an hour, assuming you play along with some of the
examples. There is also :ref:`a screencast <screencast>` that roughly
follows the tutorial, if videos are more your speed.
