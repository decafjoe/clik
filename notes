- Py2/Py3 compatibility
  - "reference" (python 3) implementation should be clean and compat-cruft-free
  - API needs to be the same to the calling code (i.e. Command)

- {command} if len(children) > 3 (or 4, or N) instead of based on terminal
  width

- get rid of single if/else lines -- bad for code coverage

- copyright
  - compat.py
  - magic.py

- no positional args for bare commands

- exception hierarchy

- example/functional test: commands

- clik-config
- clik-logging
- clik-shell
