- Py2/Py3 compatibility
  - "reference" (python 3) implementation should be clean and compat-cruft-free
  - API needs to be the same to the calling code (i.e. Command)

- {command} if len(children) > 3 (or 4, or N) instead of based on terminal
  width

- get rid of single if/else lines -- bad for code coverage

- copyright
  - compat.py
  - magic.py

- command args help (i.e. break out of "optional commands" into separate
  "command options")
- supplying command args to subcommand fails

- example/functional test: commands
- example/functional test: aliases
- example/functional test: deeply nested subcommands
