- no positional args for bare commands
  - mutex groups on bare commands?
    - if user provides both with subcommand, will error out with mutex error,
        not with "invalid with subcommand" error

- exception hierarchy?

- natural order for metavar ({foo,bar} instead of {bar,foo})

- always insert exit codes at position 0
  - make clik exit as soon as there's a non-zero exit code?

- add else clauses to loops that should always break
